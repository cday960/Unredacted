- Project MK-ULTRA was‘ first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by the U .S. Congress, througliinvcstigations
by the Church Committee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. Investigative
efforts were hampered by-the fact that CIA Direct0rRichard I-Ielmsordercd all MK-ULTRA tiles destroyed in '
I973; the Church Committee‘ and Rockefeller Coinniission investigations relied on the swoni testimony of direct
participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms’ destruction order.l4l
Although the CIA insists that MK-ULTRA-type experiments have been abandoned, 14-year CIA veteran Victor
Marchctti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinclyconducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA
mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MK-ULTRA
was abandoned a "cover story. "[5][6]

On the Senate tloor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said:

"extensive testing and experimentation" progiam which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens "at all 5'-

Division, followed by the word UL'!‘R/I (which had previously been used to designate the most secret
classification ofWorld War ll intelligence). Other related cryptonyms include MK-NAOMI and MK-DELTA.
A precursorofthe MK-ULTRA program began in I945 when the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was
established and given direct responsibility for Operation Paperclip. Openrtion Papcrclip was a program to
recnrit former Nazi scientists. Some of these scientists studied torture and brainwashing, and several had just
been identified and prosecuted as war criminals during the Nuremberg Trialsplllol
Several secret U.S. govemment projects grew out of Operation Papcrclip. These projccu included Project
CllA'|'l'ER (established I947), and Project BLUEBIRD (established I950). which was later renamed to
Project ARTICHOKE in l95l. Their purpose was to study mind-control. interrogation, behavior
modification and related topics.
Headed by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the MK-ULTRA project was staned on
the order ofClA director Allen Dulles on April ts, r9s3,l"l largely in I
response to Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use ofmind-control
techniques on U.S. prisoners ofwar in Korcadm The CIA wanted to
use similar methods on their own captives. The CIA was also interested
in being able to manipulate foreign leaders with such techniques,‘ ml turd
would later invent several schemes to drug Fidel Castro.
Forpcriments were oflen conducted without the subjects‘ knowledge or
cunsentlm In some cases, academic researchers being funded through
grants from CIA front organizations were unaware that their work was
being used for these purposes.ll5l
ln l964, the project was renamed MK-SEARCH. The project attempted to produce a perfect truth drug for use in Sidney Gonna’
interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War. and generally to explore any other possibilities ofmind control.
Another MK-ULTRA elTort, Subproject S4, was the Navy's top secret "Perfect Concussion" program. which used sub-aural frequency blasts to erase
mt-mory.l l 5‘
Because most MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in I973 by order ofthen CIA Director Richard Helms. it has been difficult. ifnot impossible,
for investigators to gain a complete understanding ofthe more than l50 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MK-ULTRA and related CIA
prognrrns.[m
Goals
The Agency poured millions ofdollars into studies probing dozens ofmcthods ofinflucncing and controlling the mind. One I955 MK-ULTRA document gives
an indication ofthe size and range ofthe effort; this document refers to the study ofan assortment ofmind-altering substances described as follows: U5]
l. Substances which will promote illogical thinking and impulsiveness to the point where the recipient would be discredited in public.
2. Substances which increase the efliciency of mentation and perception.
3. Materials which will prevent or counteract the intoxicating effect ofalcohol.
4. Mater-iaLs which will promote the intoxicating effect ofalcohol.
5. Materials which will produce the signs and symptoms of recognized diseases in a reversible way so that they may be used for malingering.
CKC.
6. Materials which will render the induction ofhypnosis easier or otherwise enhance its usefulness.
7. Substances which will enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion during interrogation and so-called
"bnrin-washing".
8. Materials and physical methods which will produce amnesia for events preceding and during their use.
9. Physical methods ofproducing shock and confusion over extended periods of time and capable ofsurreptitiuus use.
I0. Substances which produce physical disablement such as paralysis ofthe legs, acute anemia, etc.
I l. Substances which will produce "pure" euphoria with no subsequent let-down.
I2. Substances which alter personality structure in such a way that the tcndcncy ofthe recipient to become dependent upon another person is
enhanced.
I3. A material which will cause mental conftrsion ofsuch a type that the individual under its influence will find it diflicult to maintain a
fabrication under questioning.
I4 Substances which will lower the ambition and general working efficiency ofmen when administered in undetectable amounts.
l5 Substances which promote weakness or distortion ofthe eyesight or hearing faculties, preferably without permanent efl'ecLs,
I6. A knockout pill which cart surreptitiously he administered in drinks, food. cigarettes. as an aerosol. ctc., which will be safe to use, provide a maximum ofarnnesia, and be suitable for use by agent types on an trd hoe basis.
l7 A material which can be srrrrcptitiotrsly administered by the above routes and which in very small amounts will make it impossible for a man
to perfon-n any physical activity whatsoever.
Historians have asserted that creating tr "Manchurian Candidate" subject through "mind control" techniques was a goal ofMK-ULTRA and related CIA

Budget
A secretive arrangement gmnted the MK-ULTRA program a percentage ofthe CIA budget. The MK-ULTRA director was granted six percent ofthe CIA ‘operating budget in I953, without oversight or accounting.[2°l An estimated USSIOm or more was spent.l2']
Experiments
CIA documents suggest that "chemical, biological and nrdiological" means we_re investigated for the purpose ofmind conn-_ol as part of MK-ULTRA.ml
LSI)
Early efforts focused on LSD, which later came to dominate many ofMK-UI.TRA's progmms. lixperiments included administering LSD to CIA employees,
and
military
other
personnel, doctors. other govemment agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions. LSD drugs were usually administered without the subject's knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code that the U.S. agreed to follow afler World War II.
-
ElTot1s to "recruit" subjects were ofien illegal, even discounting the fact that drugs were being administered (tltough actual use ofLSD, for example. was legal in the United States until October 6, I966). In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels to obtain a selection ofmen who would be too embamssed to talk about the e\'enLs. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with oaevway mi.rrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study.m]
Some subjects‘ participation was consensual, and in many ofthese cases, the subjects appeared to be singled out foreven more extreme experiments. ln one case, volunteers were given LSD for 77 consecutive daysml '
LSD was evenmally dismissed by MK-ULTRA's researchers as too unpredictable in its results,lZ5] Although useful infommtion was sometimes obtained through questioning subjects on LSD, not uncommonly the most marked elTect would be the subject's absolute and utter certainty Lhat they were able to withstand any fonn ofinterrogation attempt, even physical torture.
Other drugs
I i
Another technique investigated was connecting a barbiturate IV into one ann and an amphetamine IV into the other-J26] The barbiturates were released into the subject first. and as soon as I.he subject began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released. The subject would begin babbling incoherently at this point, and it was sometimes possible to ask questions and get useful answers. Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temalepam (used under code name MK-SEARCH), mcscalinc, psilocybin, scopolamine, marijuana, alcohol, sodium pentothal.l27] and crgine (in Subproject 22).
'
Ilypnosis and Magic '
Declassified MK-ULTRA documents indicate hypnosis was studied in the early I9S0s. Experimental goals included: the creation of"hypnotical|y induced anxieties," "hypnotically increasing ability to leam and recall complex written matter." studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations. "hypnotically increasing
ability to observe and recall complex arrangements ofphysical objects." and studying "relationship ofpersonaliry to susceptibility to hypnosisfml
In addition, the CIA used the services ofAmer-ican magician John Mulholland to write two manuals on sleight ofhand and ttndercover communication techniques. In I973, vimrally all documents related to MKULTRA were desooyed. MulholIand's manuals were thought to be among them until a single surviving copy of each was discovered in the agency's archives around 2008-2009. Bob Wallace and H. Keith Melton published "Thu Oflieial CIA Mmrrrul 15/ 'I7'icIrur_v uml Duct:/rrin/r" to chronicle this research into the use of illusion for the agency's field agcntsm]
Canadian experiments
The experiments were exponed to Canada when the CIA recnrited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the "psychic driving" concept, which the CIA found particularly interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to worlt at the Allan Memorial Institute ofMcGill University and was paid $69,000 from I957 to I964 to carry out MKULTRA experimenu there. In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic d.rtrgs as well as elecooconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the nomral power. His "driving" experiments consisted ofputting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically canied out on patients who had
entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many ofwhom suffered permanently fi-orn his aetionsml His
treaurtents resulted in victims’ incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to r.alk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parentsml His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist Dr. William Sargant at St. Thomas‘ Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey. who_was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented extensively on his patients without Lhcir consent. causing sirrtilar long-tenn damagepzl Dr. Cameron and Dr. Sargant are l.hc only two identified Canadian experimenters, but the MKULTRA file makes reference to many other unnamed physicians who were recruited by the ClA.l"”""”'l "“""“n It was during this cm that Cameron became known worldwide as the first chainnan of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president ofthe American and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron had also been a member ofthe Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946-1947.13"

In I973, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MK-ULTRA files destroyed. Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding tlte project were destroyed, malting a full investigation of MK-ULTRA impossible.
In December I974, The New Ilrrlr 77mc.r reponed that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens. during the
I
l960s. That repon prompted investigations by the U.S. Congress, in the form of the Church Cornmit-tee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission that looked into domestic activities ofthe CIA, the FBI. and intelligence-related agencies ofthe military. In the summer of I975. congressional Church Cotrunittcc reports and tlte presidential Rockefeller Cotrtmission report revealed to the public for the first time that tlte CIA attd the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as pan ofan extensive program to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline at1d other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject had died allcr administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Corrtrnittec and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKULTRA was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector Genctal's olliee in I963, that had survived the destruction ofrecords ordered in I973.mi However, it contained little detail.
The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator Frank Church. concluded that "[p]rior consent was obviously not obtained from any ofthe subjects". 'I‘hc comminec noted that the "experiments sponsored by these researchers call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments."
Fo|Iowi.rtg the recommendations ofthe Church Committee, President Gerald Ford in I976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which. among other tltings, prohibited "experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and wiutcsscd by a disinterested
party, ofcach such human subject" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Caner and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation. i
'_
On the heels ofthe revelations about CIA experiments. similar stories surfaced regarding U.S. Anny experiments. In I975 the Secretary ofthe An-ny instructed the Anny Inspector General to conduct an investigation. Among the findings ofthe Inspector General was the existence ofa I953 memorandum penned by then Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson. Documents show that the CIA participated in at lent two ofDepanmcnt of Defense committees during I952. These committee findings led to the issuance ofthe "vlftlson Memo," which mandated—in accord with Nuremberg Code protocols—tltat only volunteers be used for experimental operations conducted in the U.S. armed forces. In response to the Inspector General‘s investigation, the Wilson Memo was declassified in August I975.
With regard to drug testing within the Army, the Inspector General found that "the evidence clearly reflected that every possible medical consideration was observed by the professional investigators at the Medical Research Laboratories“ However the Inspector General also found that the mandated requirements of Wilson's I953 memorandum had been only partially adhered to: he concluded that the "volunteers were not fully infonned, as required, prior to thei.r participation; and the methods ofprocuring their services. in many cases, appeared not to have been in accord with the intent ofDepartment ofthe Array -
policies goveming use ofvolunteers in research." _
Other branches of the U.S. armed forces, the Air Force for example, were found not to have adhered to Wilson Memo stipulations regarding voluntary dntg testtng.
In I977, during a hearing held by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to look further into MKULTRA, Admiral Stansfield Tumer, then Director of
Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set ofrecords. consisting ofabout 20,000 pagcs,[35) that had survived the I973 destruction orders, due to
having been stored at a records center not usually used for such doeumcntsim These files dealt with the financing ofMKULTRA projects, and as such contained few deutils ofthose projects. but much more was lcamed from them than from the Inspector Genetal's I963 repon.
In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in I984 on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation news show, The Fiftlt E.\'II|1t:. It was leamed that not only had the CIA fitndcd Dr. Carneron‘s efforts, but perhaps even more shockingly, the Canadian govemmcnt was fully aware ofthis, and had
later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U,S. counterparts had. and the Canadian govcmment eventually settled out of court for Sl00,000 to each ofthe I27 victims. None of Dr. Cameron‘s personal records
ofhis involvement with MKULTRA sunrivc, since his family destroyed them alter his death from a heart anock while mountain climbing in I967.im
U.S. General Accounting Office Report "
_
The U.S. General Accounting Offee issued a repon on September 28, I994, which stated that between I940 and I974, DOD artd other national security agencies studied thousands ofhuman subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances. The quote from the study:
Working with the CIA, the Department ofDcfcnse gave hallucinogenic dntgs to thousands of"volunteer" soldiers in the I950s and 19605. In
addition to LSD. the Anny also tested quinuclidinyl benzilate, a hallucinogen code-named BZ. (Note 37) Many ofthese tests were conducted under
the so-called MKULTRA program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between I953 and
I964, thc program consisted of I49 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects...p7]
Legal issues involving informed consent
The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number ofsubjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting
illegal experiments. Although the govcmment aggressively. and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability. several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-'of-coun settlement, or acts ofCongress. Fmnlr Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act ofCongress, and both
President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson's family to publicly apologize.
Previously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating infomtation, even as they secretly provided compensation to
the families. One subject ofArmy drug experimentation, James Stanley, an Array sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The govemment argued that Stanley was bar-red from suing under a legal doctr-ine—known as the Fercs docu-inc, aller a I950 Supreme Court case. Ft:rc.\' \-. Uttita<lStnte.t—that
prohibits members ofthe Armed Forces from suing the govcmmenr for any hamts that were inflicted "incident to service." In I987, the Supreme Coun alfinned

this defense in a 5-4 decision that dismissed Stanley‘s caseml The majority argued that "a test for liability that depends on the extent to which panicular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itselfrequirejudicial inquiry into. and hence intrusion upon. military matters." ln dissent. Justice William Brennan argued that the nced to preserve military discipline should not protect the govcmment from liability and punishment for serious violations ofconstitutional rights:
The medical trials at Nuremberg in I947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with uaknowi.|1g human subjects is morally and
legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which tojudge German scientists who experimented with human subjects... . [l]n defiance nflhis principle, military intelligence oflicials began surre-ptitictusly testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD. .
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing a separate dissent, stated:
Nojudicially crafied rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this
case. Indeed. as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi ollicinls who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War. and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior ofthe defendants stated that the 'voltt.t'ttary consent ofthe human subject is absolutely essential to satisfy moral. ethical. and legal
concepts.‘ lfthis principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be. by the
perpetrators.
This is the only Supreme Coun case to address the application ofthe Nuremberg Codc to experimentation sponsored by the U.S. government. And while the suit was unsuccessful. dissenting opinions put the Army—and by association the entire govcmment—on notice that use ofindividuals without their consent is unacceptable. The limited application ofthe Nuremberg Code in U.S. couns does not detntct from the power ofthe principles it espouses. especially in light of stories of failure to follow these principles that appeared in the media and professional liremntre during the I960: and l970s and the policies eventually adopted in the mid-19705.
In another law suit. Wayne Ritchie, a fonncr United States Marshall, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a I957 Christmas party. While the govemment admitted it was. at that time. drugging people Without their consent, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKULTRA and dismissed the case in 2007.09]
Extent of participation
Forty-four American colleges or universities, fifteen research foundations or chemical or phamtaceutical companies artd the like including Sandoz (currently Novartis) and Eli Lilly St C0,, twelve hospitals or clinics (in addition to those associated with universities), and three prisons are known to have participated in Mt<ut.TaA.l‘°"“'l
Notable subjects
A considerable amount ofcredible circumstantial evidence suggests that Theodore Kaczynski. also known as the Unabomber, panieipated in CIA-sponsored MK-ULTRA experiments conducted at Harvard University from the fall of I959 through the spring of i962. J42] During World War ll, Henry Murnty, the lead researcher in the Harvard experiments, served with the Oflice of Strategic Services (OSS), which was a forerunner ofthe CIA. Manny applied for a grant
funded by the United States Navy, and his Harvard stress experiments strongly resembled those n.tn by the OSS.ml Beginning at the age ofsixteen, Kaczynski panicipated along with twenty-one other undergraduate sntdents in the Harvard experiments, which have been described as "disntrbing" and "ethically
indefensible."[ul['ul
Merry Prankster Ken Kesey. author of One Flew (Iver the Cm-I<tm'.t i\'u.\'l, volunteered for M K-ULTRA experiments while he was a student at Stanford

(U) US Govemment interest in the potential intelligence implicatiotts ofphannaccuticals dates to World War II, when the V

(U) Alter the end ofthe Korean War in I953 and the return of US POWs from China and Nonh Korea, fears arose that the l__-bf, Communist had discovered ways to control minds through "brainwashing" techniques or the use of mind-altering dntgs, E
such V as LSD. The purported victims of such treatment would become unwitting pawns of t.he Communists, who could i_"'*_‘“"
"program" them'for nefarious purposes. Feeding this anrtiety in the late l940s and early l950s were displays of disoriented Fmnk om“ . or inexplicable behavior by prisoners in Comrnttnist “show trials“ and persistent charges that Moscow had attempted to
corner the world supply of LSD chemicals, then manufactured only in SwitzerIand.l“]
0SS's Research and Development Branch conducted research into their behavioral eITecLs, as well as those ofbiological _
and chemical _ weapons. The US Army picked up on those elTons in the late I940s. Reports at tl1at time indicated that the
r Q,“ ,1 Soviet Union was experimenting with mind-control substances, which heightened CIA's interest in the development of ‘ 4?‘ "I "
dntgs and the investigation of"mind control" methods so it could develop defensive measures against them.l“l :1

A
(S) Such concems in the aflemtath ofseveral failed Agency operations in Eastern Europe, most notably in Albania, prompted the Agency's Ofiice of Security under DCI Walter Bedell Smith to launch an investigation, Project BLUEBIRD, to determine whether the polygraph or hypnosis assisted by "truth sentms" could detect “bminwashing" among government employees. Another project growing from BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, conducted by CIA's Technical Services Stafi'(TSS), and qflicially launched on 29 October I952, began research and experimenuttion with a variety ofpsychiatrie and psychological methods
—ittcluding the use ofvarious narcotics—to see if these could alter attitudes and behaviorslfll
(S) Under DCI Allen W. Dulles. who publicly declared that the Soviets were developing “brain perversion techniques" in a “sinister battle for men's minds," the behavioral programs significantly expanded in April I953 on the suggestion ofllichard Helms, head ofClA operations. The Agency soonjoined its research efforts with Army programs under the cryptony-m MKULTRA. Run by TSS chiefDr. Sidney Gottlieb. the program came to include I49 separate animal and human behavior modification projects. some conducted by Agency and An-ny researchers, but most involving one of80 participating American and Canadian
universities, hospitals, and research institutions operating under contracts that did not reveal Agency funding or ussociations.m]
I
(S) As pan ofthcse drttg research efforts, on I8 November I953 Gonlieb met with a group ofClA and Army researchers at a lodge in Deep Creek Lake. MD. to discuss work that included the use of LSD. During the meeting, eight of the ten men present—including Frank Olson—consumed a small dose of the hallucinogen in a liquor drink passed among them. According to Gottlieb, all present were wining of the dntgs in the beverage. However, the Agency's intemal investigation concluded that while Gottlieb had conducted the experiment with Olson's knowledge, neither he nor the others in the group knew what dntg they had ingested until some 20 minutes later. In the days that followed, according to Olson Family members and his colleagues. Olson began to act strangely and appeared depressed. Realizing that Olson may have a serious ilhtess. Gottlieb referred him for psychiatric counseling in New York. Olson worsened, and his associates decided to send him to a sanatorium near Rockvillc. MD. On the night before their depamrre, Olson crashed through a closed hotel window and
hurtled I0 stories to his death. His CIA companion woke in time to see the suicide but not prevent it.[“]
(S) Gottlieb rcponed the death to Dulles, who ordered the CIA inspector general, Lyman Kirkpatrick. to conduct an invcstigation.Kirkpatrick recommended a reprimand for Gottlieb, who he asserted had exercised poorjudgment in conducting uncontrolled experiments that “could seriously affect the record and reputation oftlte Agency." Kirkpatrick further faulted Gottlieb for not knowing of Olson's prior bouts of depression. implying that the LSD experiment had acted as n triggering mechanism directly contributing to his dcath. Kirkpatrick and Lawrence Houston, the Agency's general counsel, expressed dismay with the casual manner in which TSS personnel conducted the experiments, and were outraged to leam that that Gottlieb had ingested LSD at least twelve times hitnself. They derem-tincd that TSS personnel assumed risks irt a cavalier manner that lay well beyond the normal standards oftlte scientific process. Ilowever, Dulles ovemtled the IG, and Gottlieb received only an ofi'-the-record admonition. MKULTRA continued, albeit with significant changes and additional oversight, until
I967: remnants of it continued under another project until I973.l48] '
(U) Olson's wife initially received word that her husband had died ofa “classified illness" and only later lcamed how he had been killed. Not until I975, with the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee disclosures. did Olson's family hear more ofthe tntth. They disputed much of what came out and claimed that the Agency or the Army had murdered Olson before he could go public with the details ofthe dntg testing programs. In I976. the family received a
$750,000 settlement from the US Govemment and fon-nal apologies from President Gerald R. Ford and DCI William E. Colby.m)
(U) The complete record ofthe case was hard to reconstruct because in I973, at Hclrns's behest. Gottlieb had destroyed his ofiice's records on MKULTRA. In I977. thousands of pages of related material about the program ttu'ned up in budget records and, when released under the Freedom of Information Act. became the basis for an expose book by fonrter State Department ofiicer John Marks called The Search for the “Manchurian Candidate": The CIA and Mind Control. Members of0lson's family continued pursuing allegations ofAgency foul play for many years but in 2002 announced that they were dropping the matter. Joumalist H.P. Albarelli resuscitated the Olson version ofevents in 2009 in a poorly sourced and unreliable book titled A Terrible Mistake; The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA's Secret Cold War Experiments. Trustwonhy accounts ofthe story are in John Ranelagh, The Agency: The Rise and Decline ofthe CIA (pp. 202~07, 755-58 notes 27-6|) and Benjamin Fischer. Filly Years of Supponing Opcmtiotts.
